# Misc. directory
This directory is for files which are not amendments for the ISO-3166 data, but rather "helper files" to validate the content of all directories.

## Contents
- `known_name_duplicates.json` - Denotes all countries (in ISO 3166-1) for which a country occurs more than once. For example, `HU` has "Hungary" as both its `"name"` and `"official_name"`. This file is useful in case a country name -> country mapping is needed.
