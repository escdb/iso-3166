This (user-assigned) alpha-2 code was introduced in 2018, but did not take into account the user-assignable space of ISO 3166. Since 'WA' is not an official ISO 3166 alpha-2 code, it should thus probably be moved to another code (Q_ or X_) at some point. XW would be the most logical choice, but that code is (at this moment) already in use. The alpha-3 code was made after the creation of this repository and does thus respect the user-assignable space.",
